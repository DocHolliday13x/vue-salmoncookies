# LAB - Class 40

## Project: Vue - Salmon Cookies

### Author: Ryan Eastman, Kao Saelor, Kenya Womack, Coriana Williams

### Problem Domain  

For the purposes of educating your class/teammates, your group will implement the “Salmon Cookies” application using your assigned framework, with all features from the original assignment.

Assume, for this assignment, that your employer has asked your team to do a proof of concept of a javascript framework, to assess it’s viability as a replacement for their legacy system. Your task will be to complete a full analysis report and give a presentation to the class as to your findings.

- [front-end application](https://vue-salmoncookies.netlify.app/)

### Setup

1. We created the application using the Vue.js framework.
2. `npm init vue@latest`
3. We then had to choose optional features.
4. Then we cd into the directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
5. We gather proof of life by running `npm run dev` to make sure the application is running.
6. We then created a repository on GitHub and pushed our code to it.
7. We then created a Netlify account and connected it to our GitHub repository.

#### `.env` requirements (where applicable)

For now, we have none and do not require one.

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application.

#### Features / Routes

- Feature One: Details of feature
- GET : `/hello` - specific route to hit

#### Tests

- *How do you run tests?*
- *Any tests of note?*
- *Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc*

#### UML

Link to an image of the UML for your application and response to events

#### JS Framework Comparative Analysis

**Framework Name:** Vue.js

**Research Conducted By:** Ryan Eastman, Kao Saelor, Kenya Womack, Coriana Williams

**Overall Score and Comments:**
Score (Out of 10): 7

**General Comments**
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is supposedly easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

**Describe the stack (front-end only? full stack?), database, efficiency, etc. Describe the general usability and learnability.**
Our application is a front-end only, full stack application. It is very similar to React.js. It is somewhat user-friendly in regard to picking it up and learning to utilize it. I can't speak about the level of difficulty required to integrate this with other libraries or existing projects, becuase we built it from scratch simply referncing the prior version of Salmon Cookies that we built earlier in tandom with the documentation provided by Vue.js.

**Pros:**

- Simplicity
- Appealing Stylization

**Cons:**

- Documentation is a little less in depth than than other frameworks.
- Not as popular as other frameworks.

**Ratings and Reviews:**

**Systems Requirements:**

- *What is required to run this framework?* To run this framework, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
- *What systems did you test this framework on (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.)?* We tested this framework on Windows 11 Pro with WSL2.
- *What tools (editor, IDE, unit testing, etc.) did you use to develop this framework?* We used VS Code as our IDE and GitHub for version control.

**Documentation:**
*Above and beyond ‘node’ and ‘linux’, what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework? Is it easily deployable to the cloud? Does it require a certain database?* Some additional dependencies such as Vue Router, Vuex, and Vue CLI are required to build a full stack application. It is easily deployable to the cloud. It does not require a certain database.

**Ramp-Up Projections:**
*How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive?* It would take a team of mid-junior developers about 2 weeks to become productive.

**Community Support and Adoption levels:**
*How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it “seen” in the general JS community? Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it?* Vue.js is not as popular as other frameworks, but it is still widely used. Some big companies that use Vue.js are GitLab, Alibaba, and Nintendo. It is seen as a good framework in the general JS community. There is an active community of developers supporting and growing it. I intend to contribute to it via open source projects in the near future.
