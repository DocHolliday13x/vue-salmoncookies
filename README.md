## Project: Vue - Salmon Cookies

### Author: Ryan Eastman, Kao Saelor, Kenya Womack, Coriana Williams

### Problem Domain  

For the purposes of educating your class/teammates, your group will implement the “Salmon Cookies” application using your assigned framework, with all features from the original assignment.

Assume, for this assignment, that your employer has asked your team to do a proof of concept of a javascript framework, to assess it’s viability as a replacement for their legacy system. Your task will be to complete a full analysis report and give a presentation to the class as to your findings.

### Setup

1. We created the application using the Vue.js framework.
2. `npm init vue@latest`
3. We then had to choose optional features.
4. Then we cd into the directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
5. We gather proof of life by running `npm run dev` to make sure the application is running.
6. We then created a repository on GitHub and pushed our code to it.
7. We then created a Netlify account and connected it to our GitHub repository.
